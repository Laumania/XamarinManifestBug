# XamarinManifestBug
Repo to demonstrate wierd ApplicationManifest bug in Xamarin Android.

The bug is about the Android app running laggy/slow if you change the order of the <uses-sdk ... /> tag in the ApplicationManifest.xml file. If the order matter so much, please either fail or tell us about it. Just lagging is wierd :)
